🔐 **Project Privex**  
A next-gen private messaging app… currently being assembled by sleep-deprived developers.

---

## 🚀 About the Project  
Welcome to **Privex**, a private messaging app designed for **global, fast, and ultra-secure communication**.  
Think of it as *Telegram’s cooler cousin* — the one who travels the world, lifts weights, and knows encryption like a second language.

⚠️ **Note:** The project is still in progress. Yes, we know… *Rome wasn’t built in a day.*  
But we promise it will be worth the wait!

## 🔥 Key Features (Planned)

- **End-to-end encryption** so strong even your future self can’t hack it.  
- **Beautiful UI** that makes Telegram jealous.  
- **Worldwide messaging** with low latency.  
- **Zero tracking, zero ads, zero nonsense.**  
- **Modern tech stack** with high performance and developer sanity intact (hopefully).
