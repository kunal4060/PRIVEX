# PRIVEX
🔐 Project privex
A next-gen private messaging app… currently being assembled by sleep-deprived developers.
🚀 About the Project
Welcome to NebulaChat, a private messaging app designed for global, fast, and ultra-secure communication.
Think of it as Telegram’s cooler cousin — the one who travels the world, lifts weights, and knows encryption like a second language.
⚠️ Note: The project is still in progress. Yes, we know… Rome wasn’t built in a day.
But we promise it will be worth the wait!

🔥 Key Features (Planned)
End-to-end encryption so strong even your future self can’t hack it.
Beautiful UI that makes Telegram jealous.
Worldwide messaging with low latency.
Zero tracking, zero ads, zero nonsense.
Modern tech stack with high performance and developer sanity intact (hopefully).
